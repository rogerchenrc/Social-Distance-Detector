# Social-Distance-Detector

## Introduction
This is a final-year software engineering project embedded with SOTA yolo v.4 to detect humans. It aims to work in a real-time scenario with light requirements for the hardware device. It can help to collect data through surveillance cameras and calculate the violation rate of certain areas. With the implementation of motion tracking and angle calibration, accuracy is enhanced and shows more realistic raw data for further processing.
